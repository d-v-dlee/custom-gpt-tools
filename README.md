# Project: Creating Custom OpenAI Plugins

## Introduction
In this project, we will create custom OpenAI plugins. These plugins can then be used a tools by AI agents.

## Getting Started
Creating a plugin takes 3 steps:

1. Build an API
2. Document the API in the OpenAPI yaml or JSON format
3. Create a JSON manifest file that will define relevant metadata for the plugin

## Tools We've Built
So far, we have built scraper and OCR tools, and we have more on the way. These tools will serve as examples for how to create custom OpenAI plugins.

By following the steps above, you can create your own custom OpenAI plugins and extend the capabilities of the platform to meet your needs.
